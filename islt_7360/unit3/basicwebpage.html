<h1>Jackie's Basic Webpage</h1>

<blockquote>Here, I will discuss two topics that would make for a good final webpage. Please note that this is a blockquote.</blockquote>
<br>

<h2><em>Topic One: Personal Website</em></h2>

<p>My <strong>number one </strong>topic of choice is to create a personal webpage where I can direct potential employers. I am about to graduate and I need to find work, so a personal website could help me get the attention of recruiters. It would include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>My resume</li>
    <li>Examples of my past work</li>
    <li>My contact information</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Topic Two: Thesis Website</em></h2>

<p>Another topic I could use for my website would be to feature my thesis work. I'm in the process of writing a thesis on Generation Z, <a href="https://netflix.com">Netflix</a> and product placement. I could use the site as a way to organize my research and showcase it to interested parties.</p>
