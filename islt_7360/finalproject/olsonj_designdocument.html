<h1>Jackie Olson's Design Document</h1>

<h2>Website Overview</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This website is intended to demonstrate my capabilities as an employee to advertising industry recruiters. I will send it to companies that I would like to work for in addition to my resume and cover letter. This website is important to me and my specified audience of potential employers because it provides an overview of my abilities and accomplishments, which gives employers a way to understand the skills they could expect me to demonstrate if they were to hire me. It is supposed to help me find a job.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>Potential employers will be from the advertising or communications industries. They could be young, new employees tasked with finding other entry-level recruits, or older, established employees who know that the company needs to expand or fill a vacated position. Regardless, they will have a working knowledge of the web and how to navigate personal sites and networking sites like LinkedIn. They will be either actively looking for a new employee, or I will have reached out to them/their company to request that they keep my information on file if the need for a new employee arises. They will likely reference the site once or twice total as they explore it first to see who I am, and then hopefully again as they show other employees my credentials as they consider me as a job candidate. They are likely working on lots of other projects at their company and have limited time to spend looking at my site and learning about me, which is why the site will have to provide my information quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I will use red, white and black to craft a website with a clean, professional appearance. I am choosing simplistic colors and planning on using lots of white space because that is what other personal websites look like. This way, it will be clear to my audience that they have come to the right website as soon as they open the link. I want it to look like other personal sites so that the experience is straightforward and gets my audience the information they are looking for without having to work hard to find it. Additionally, my resume uses red accents, so carrying that red over to the site will make everything look cohesive and help me craft a personal brand.</p> 
<p>There will be navigational tabs for my introductory/home page, where I will introduce myself by writing a ‘hello’ and including my photograph, my work page where I will lay out examples of my past work that demonstrate my skills, my resume page where recruiters can download a copy of my resume and my contact page where my contact information will be displayed. I believe these options will be what recruiters are looking for when they visit my site, and having a navigational link for each will make it easy for them to find everything they need quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ol>
    <li>A recruiter posts a job listing on LinkedIn. I find it and apply with my LinkedIn profile, resume, cover letter and website url. S/he opens my website while in the process of evaluating my credentials. S/he is able to view projects that I’ve worked on and achievements I’ve accumulated via my website, and decides that I would be a good candidate for an interview. S/he calls me using the information provided on my website.</li>
    <li>Although they have not posted a job listing, I reach out to a company I am particularly interested in working for via email and provide them with my resume, LinkedIn and website url. An employee connected to the HR/recruiting department opens the email and clicks the link to my website to find out more about me. S/he reviews the examples of my work and sees my skills and abilities demonstrated. S/he sends the url along to other employees in charge of hiring and contacts me using the contact information on the site to call me in for an interview.</li>
    <li>A friend of mine in the advertising/communications industry hears that one of their business connections is looking for a new employee. My friend forwards them my website url so that they can quickly find out about me and determine whether I would be a good fit for the position. The potential employer views my abilities and skills by clicking through my past work and resume pages, and decides to call me in for an interview using the information provided on my contact page.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Audience Interviews</h2>
<p>I reached out to four advertising industry personnel to find out what they are looking for in a job candidate’s personal website. I wanted to be sure that I would provide all of the information they might be looking for in one place. They were asked the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>What is the most important item on a personal site?</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important item on a personal site is an example of whatever skill you’re trying to sell or past works. Second is an about section that isn’t just a resume regurgitated so that I know you’re a real person.</li>
                <li>Being able to show your work, what you’ve been able to accomplish and how your skills are reflected in it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <li><em><strong>What do you expect to be included on a personal site?</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples of work, about, contact, a link to download a copy of your resume.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    <li><em><strong>What design elements indicate a professional personal site?</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>When the domain is someone’s name, and there’s an “about” section.</li>
                <li>A clean site organized around a persona.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
     <li><em><strong>What is one element you can recall from another personal site that you found especially helpful or desirable? What is something that stood out to you in a positive way?</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li>Organized portfolios are always great - when you divide your work into relevant sections, like if they’re a graphic design that also does motion graphics or webs design. It’s always good to have A1 personal branding on a website so that it doesn’t fade away from my mind.</li>
                <li>Easy navigation coupled with lots of work that is organized in an easily ‘snackable’ way.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

</ul>

<h2>Reference Websites</h2>
<p>Based on the answers given to my interview questions, the following websites are examples of good and bad personal websites:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://madsiri.com/">madsiri.com</a>: This site uses clean navigation, presents the type of work that my interviewees were looking for, and includes an interesting 'about' page that helps set Maddy apart as a job candidate.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.tymandrews.com/">tymandrews.com</a>: Tym does a good job of using his home page to introduce himself.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.sarah-ong.com/">sarah-ong.com</a>: Sarah’s site does a great job of breaking up her work into bite-sized sections that are easy to understand and peruse, without the anxiety of clutter or the feeling of being lost.</li>
    <li><a href="http://jackdavison.co.uk/work-ii-01">jackdavidson.co.uk</a>: Jack’s website is very clean, but lacks navigation. Visitors understand who Jack is and what he likes to do, but the user has no control over his/her experience on the website. Even the mouse disappears and users are left to blindly click through examples of the artist’s work - I do not want potential employers to feel powerless and in the dark as they try to click through my site.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.whatsarahsdoing.com/">whatsarahsdoing.com</a>: Although Sarah keeps her pages clean and its easy to understand how to navigate the site, she has not updated her site in a long time, it takes a long time for her large images to load, and there are often glitches on her website (sometimes content shows up at the bottom of the page instead of the top).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation of Information</h2>
<p>My website will have four pages including the landing page because I am trying to keep it clean, easy to navigate and easy to visit quickly. There will be a horizontal navigational menu that remains static on each page with links to the four pages so that users can always easily jump to a different page. This will make it easy for people to view what they want and understand the layout of the site.</p> 

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Based on my online and interview research, I have decided to include the following content areas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>About: The homepage that includes a written introduction and photo of myself.</li>
    <li>Work: A page dedicated to examples of my past work. I will include examples that reflect on my unique skills and experiences, including four PDFs of creative briefs I have written, six images of creative work I have worked on and two videos detailing campaigns I have worked on.</li>
    <li>Resume: A page dedicated to showcasing my resume. Users will have the option to download a PDF of my resume.</li>
    <li>Contact: This will list my phone number, email address and LinkedIn page, along with a friendly note that encourages users to contact me soon!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access a wireframe of my proposed website <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I40KhtrikexqF6MJeS4lQLPPzFX-ls1jL4NI0PPBt1I/edit?usp=sharing">by visiting this link.</a></p>

<h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
<p>My website is well organized and easy to navigate because it clearly displays four, self-explanatory pages in a navigational menu that is consistent on each page. Users will be able to see where they want to go and where they have been at all times. It provides each of the elements that the recruiters I interviewed requested. It is crafted to provide the most efficient experience for people who might be interested in me as a job applicant. I am organizing the information in this way because of suggestions made by other websites (listed above) and interviews (summarized above). Recruiters are looking for the four basic elements/pages provided by my site. My navigation allows them to peruse these elements without hesitation or unnecessary work.</p>

<h3>Media</h3>
<p>The following media will be portrayed on my site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My professional headshot</li>
    <li>Four PDFs of creative briefs that I have written</li>
    <li>Six images of creative work I have worked on</li>
    <li>Two videos detailing campaigns I have worked on</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this media has already been produced and is accessible through my desktop and LinkedIn pages. Based on the research I have conducted, these are the items that my intended users are looking to see on my website.</p>
<p>In order to avoid copyright issues and image rights, I will credit all of the people who helped me develop the campaign images and videos. Otherwise, the work is original to me and owned by me.</p>

<h3>Color Scheme</h3>
<p>Since my resume uses red as an accent color, I’d like to continue this on my personal website to build a strong personal brand. I originally chose red because it is the most common accent color used for professional communications correspondence. It is timeless and associated with professionalism. To create the clean design that my interviewees were asking for, I’ll stick to three basic colors and maximize my white space. The following colors will be displayed on my site:</p>
<img src="blacksample.jpg" alt="blacksample.jpg" width="50" height="50">
<br>
<img src="redsample.jpg" alt="redsample.jpg" width="50" height="50">
<br>
<img src="whitesample.jpg" alt="whitesample.jpg" width="50" height="50">
