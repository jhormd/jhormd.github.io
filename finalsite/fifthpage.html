<p><strong>Q: What are you getting a master's degree in? What does it mean?</strong></p>
<p>A: I'm getting a Master of Arts degree with an emphasis in Strategic Communication from the Missouri School of Journalism.
    I've chosen to focus on qualitative research since I enjoy strategic planning in advertising. This means I'm receiving
    additional training in analyzing qualitative data like the kind gleaned from focus groups and in-depth interviews.
    I'd like to think graduate school has also expanded my horizons by exposing me to new professors, authors and subject
    matter as well. I feel that I am more well rounded, a more creative thinker and a more patient leader because of my 
    graduate classes.
</p>

<p><strong>Q: So, when exactly will you be done with your master's degree?</strong></p>
<p>A: I will finish classes in May and be available for employment on the 14th. However, I will recieve my diploma in 
    December, 2018. I was an outstanding student in my undergraduate program, so Mizzou offered to waive tuition and 
    fast track my MA program. As such, I only needed to take two semesters of classes to fulfill my degree requirements.
    To recieve a diploma, I need to log nine research hours, which I cannot technically log during a full semester of 
    classes. As such, I will remain enrolled to log the research hours over the summer, meaning the next available 
    thesis defense date is in the fall. These hours are a technicality and will not interfere with employment. I can 
    log these hours from anywhere in the world, and do not have to take any time off of work because of them. 
</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why did you decide to get a master's degree from Mizzou?</strong></p>
<p>In short, they made me an offer I couldn't refuse! Having my tuition waived and being given a fast track to a degree
    was a dream come true. I've always been nerdy at heart, and I'm enjoying getting lost in readings and learning more about
    communications every day! I hope that this degree will allow me to achieve higher level managerial positions at my place 
    of work more quickly.
