<p>After pursuing a degree in journalism for several years, I decided my overactive imagination and fascination with the way people work would be better suited for the world of advertising. I am now a masters candidate with an emphasis in Strategic Communication at the University of Missouri. I am looking forward to graduating in May of 2018 and securing a full time job.</p>
<p>As an employee, I enjoy the challenge of solving tough problems and delivering well-researched strategies. My powerful work ethic and sharp leadership skills help me stay focused until projects are absolutely client-ready. As a student, I love to learn and I dont shy away from asking difficult questions. My priority is always to deliver the best version of the work in front of me, which usually requires learning as much as I can, as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>Born and raised in the Midwest, I am excited by the idea of moving nearer to an ocean, or really anywhere warmer than Northern Illinois. I feel this would allow me to spend more time outside, doing what I love: running, rowing, eating ice cream and hanging out with my pet hedgehog, Tucker.</p>
