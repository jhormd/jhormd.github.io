<h1>Jackie Olson's Evaluation Report</h1>

<h2><em>Participants</em></h2>

<p>My friend Cassidy is in this coding class and reviewed my website from a coding/HTML/CSS perspective, as well as from a communications professional perspective as she studies Strategic Communication at Mizzou. We have known each other for many years and I've seen how well her website
    is coming along, so I value her input. She has always shown good judgment and attention to detail. She used a desktop Mac computer in the Missouri School of Journalism library to 
    look at my website and code with a Chrome browser. It was plugged in to the university's internet connection.
</p>

<p>I had my friend Max evaluate my website because he is an advertising professional who works for Jim Beam's marketing department in Chicago. We know one another because we worked together at school.
    He has shown an aptitude for personal branding, as he was able to quickly secure a job even before graduating with his Strategic Communication degree. I trust that he understands what marketing and 
    advertising professionals want to see from a potential hire. He used a MacBook Pro with a Chrome browser to evaluate my website. He used the wifi internet connection at his place of work. 
</p>

<p>My friend Elizabeth evaluated my website because she is a trained public relations professional who has designed her own personal websites in the past. She is in the capstone
    stage of her degree in Strategic Communication and deals with public relations decisions on a daily basis. I trusted her to evaluate my website from a personal branding perspective.
    Additionally, she has some design experience because of her interest in journalism, so she was able to comment on design aspects of my site. She used a MacBook Pro running Safari to evaluate my website.
