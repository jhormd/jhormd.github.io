<h1>Jackie Olson's Evaluation Report</h1>

<h2><em>Participants</em></h2>

<p>My friend Cassidy is in this coding class and reviewed my website from a coding/HTML/CSS perspective, as well as from a communications professional perspective as she studies Strategic Communication at Mizzou. We have known each other for many years and I've seen how well her website
    is coming along, so I value her input. She has always shown good judgment and attention to detail. She used a Mac laptop in the Missouri School of Journalism to 
    look at my website and code with a Chrome browser. It was running on Tiger Wifi.
</p>

<p>I had my friend Max evaluate my website because he is an advertising professional who works for Jim Beam's marketing department in Chicago. We know one another because we worked together at school.
    He has shown an aptitude for personal branding, as he was able to quickly secure a job even before graduating with his Strategic Communication degree. I trust that he understands what marketing and 
    advertising professionals want to see from a potential hire. He used a MacBook Pro with a Chrome browser to evaluate my website. He used the wifi internet connection at his place of work. 
</p>

<p>My friend Elizabeth evaluated my website because she is a trained public relations professional who has designed personal websites in the past. She is in the capstone
    stage of her degree in Strategic Communication and deals with public relations decisions on a daily basis. I trusted her to evaluate my website from a personal branding perspective.
    Additionally, she has some design experience because of her interest in journalism, so she was able to comment on the design aspects of my site. She used a MacBook Pro running Safari on Tiger Wifi to evaluate my website.

    After interviewing three of my peers, I learned that the categorization of my website is very strong. Each person appreciated the ease with which they were able to navigate the website 
    because of its clear navigational menu featuring four self-explanatory buttons. Everyone commented on how they were always able to tell where they were on the site and what they could do 
    with the site as a whole. They felt it would be clear and easy for potential employers to gather everything they needed from the structure I have now. Cassidy was unable to identify any issues
    with my code. Additionally, no one had any trouble downloading any of my content or viewing the site as a whole. 
</p>

<p>From a design standpoint, there were many notes about the color scheme that I chose for the site. Elizabeth noticed that my red resume branding aligned with the red
    on my website, which is what I was hoping for. This is great coming from Elizabeth, because she evaluates various brands (personal and organizational) all the time as a public relations
    student. She noted that it was good branding, so I will definitely continue to use this color scheme. 
</p>

<p>
    However, Max pointed out that the gray color that appears behind the navigational buttons when they are hovered over is too dark and makes it difficult to read the navigational button text. 
    Cassidy agreed and commented on other colors I could use in my CSS stylesheets. I'll have to lighten the color so that the navigational menu is easy to use and understand, as this is paramount to the structure of my website.
</p>

<p>
    None of my interviewees found any reason to doubt the credibility of my website. Elizabeth noted that the fact that she could cross reference the image of myself on the homepage and the work on 
    my 'Work' page with the information on my LinkedIn account (linked on my 'Contact' page) allowed her to hypothetically make sure I was a 'real person.' Max and Cassidy noted the information listed 
    in my footer and appreciated knowing when the site was last updated. They found the content interesting and pertinent to the end users I would like to reach. I might add more examples of my work if I come
    across more good examples as I continue to build the site, but on the whole, I think I have what I need, and what my end users are looking for, available on the site now.

<h2><em>Use Case Fulfillment</em></h2>
<p>Based on the feedback from my evaluators, I believe the site fulfills my proposed use cases. The purpose of my site is to encourage potential employers to consider me as an applicant to a Strategic 
    Communication position in the advertising or marketing industry. Each evaluator made comments about how they felt my website was everything potential employers are looking for in a personal portfolio. 
    They thought the simple navigation was prudent and helpful in making the website clear and not overwhelming to first time visitors (the majority of my users). They appreciated my personal branding and 
    consistency in form and function throughout the site. They felt that these things would make it easy for a potential employer to understand what my skills and strengths are, and pass my information on 
    to other employees at their company. Aside from the minor suggestions listed above, there were no issues or problems with the pilot design of my site that made it difficult for my test users to navigate. 
    My coding abilities meet all of the functional needs of my website at this time. </p>


<h2><em>Planned Changes</em></h2>
<p>
    Based on the feedback I've recieved, I plan to make the following changes: 
    <ul>
        <li>Lighten the gray background that appears behind the navigational buttons when users hover over them. Max and Cassidy pointed out how the text becomes difficult to read
            because of the dark nature of the gray background connected to the hover element. </li>
        <li>Correct the few spelling and grammatical errors Elizabeth pointed out to maintain the credibility of the website.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to develop the styling of my website while keeping it clean, simple and continuing the current color scheme. My evaluators appreciated most of the design choices I was
            making, but none of them seemed overly excited about the way any of the pages looked. I'd like to make the site more appealing upon first glance to catch the eye of potential employers,
            who will likely only visit the page once.
        </li>
    </ul>



<h2><em>Reflections</em></h2>
<p>Overall, I appreciated the use of this reflective exercise. I have built one other website in a different MU course, and completed a similar task for it. This made me familiar with the 
    type of feedback I could expect to receive, and made me better at asking/emphasizing the right questions on the evaluation form, which was essentially the same as the one I used in my 
    other class. I feel that I came away with a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of not only my site, but myself as a coding student. It made me think about what I want to 
    do, what I’m capable of, and how I would like to apply the skills I learn in this class to my future career.</p>

    <p>I was happy with the evaluators I chose because of their expertise in Strategic Communication. I felt good about most of the elements of my site after speaking with Max and Elizabeth, 
    because they told me that the site seemed professional and the work seemed skilled. It was really great to have Cassidy’s perspective included, as she is now familiar with HTML and 
    CSS because of her involvement with this class. I was able to ask her the questions about coding on the evaluation form that I had to delete for Elizabeth and Max, since they are unfamiliar 
    with coding as a whole. Cassidy was also able to evaluate the site with an understanding of my capabilities as a website builder, which made me trust her and want to continue to work with her 
    as I develop my site. Elizabeth made some suggestions after completing the evaluation process that are just not feasible for me as an amateur website builder, so I had to politely explain 
    the limitations and expectations of my performance in this course. With Cassidy, there was much less explaining and more quality feedback to be had. In the end I was glad I reached out to these 
    people to help me with this project.</p>
